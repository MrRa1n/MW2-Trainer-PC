# Modern Warfare 2 Stats Trainer 
This is my first application for editing player statistics in Modern Warfare 2 (v1.1.211).

The application attaches itself to the MW2 process which is running on the user's PC and allows them to edit statistics such as rank, unlocks, games played, wins, losses and kills. It is a very basic console application which reads what the user inputs and performs actions based on that.
